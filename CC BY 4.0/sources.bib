  abstract = {Software game is a kind of application that is used not only for entertainment, but also for serious purposes that can be applicable to different domains such as education, business, and health care. Although the game development process differs from the traditional software development process because it involves interdisciplinary activities. Software engineering techniques are still important for game development because they can help the developer to achieve maintainability, flexibility, lower effort and cost, and better design. The purpose of this study is to assesses the state of the art research on the game development software engineering process and highlight areas that need further consideration by researchers. In the study, we used a systematic literature review methodology based on well-known digital libraries. The largest number of studies have been reported in the production phase of the game development software engineering process life cycle, followed by the pre-production phase. By contrast, the post-production phase has received much less research activity than the pre-production and production phases. The results of this study suggest that the game development software engineering process has many aspects that need further attention from researchers; that especially includes the postproduction phase.},

It helps support project planning (e.g., How much will a new project cost?); it allows us to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the current processes and products (e.g., What is the frequency of certain types of errors?); it provides a rationale for adopting/refining techniques (e.g., What is the impact of the technique XX on the productivity of the projects?); it allows us to evaluate the quality of specific processes and products (e.g., What is the defect density in a specific system after deployment?). Measurement also helps, during the course of a project, to assess its progress, to take corrective action based on this assessment, and to evaluate the impact of such action.}

The study examines both general levels of use and variations among project types and contexts. Many aspects of project management practice are common to most projects in most contexts, while others vary significantly among different types of projects and among projects in different contexts. The purpose of this paper is to present empirical results that show both the common elements and the significant variations. The paper is based on a survey of 750 project management practitioners. The use of tools and techniques is seen here as an indicator of the realities of practice. The study found some aspects of practice to be common across all types of projects and all contexts, but on this background of similar patterns of practice, several statistically signifi-cant differences have also been identified. The primary focus of this paper is on these variations in practice.},

Objectives: To report the research we are doing to eval-uate problems associated with adopting the evidence-based paradigm in software engineering and identifying strategies to address these problems. Method: Currently the experimental paradigms used in a selected set of domains are being examined along with the experimental protocols that they employ. Our aim is to identify those domains that have generally similar charac-teristics to software engineering and to study the strategies that they employ to overcome the lack of rigorous empirical protocols. We are also undertaking a series of systematic lit-erature reviews to identify the factors that may limit their applicability in the software engineering domain. Conclusions: We have identified two domains that experi-ence problems with experimental protocols that are similar to those occurring for software engineering, and will investi-gate these further to assess whether the approaches used to aggregate evidence in these domains can be adapted for use in software engineering. Our experiences from performing systematic literature reviews are positive, but reveal infras-tructure problems caused by poor indexing of the literature.}

  abstract = {The games industry is growing worldwide, even eclipsing the global film industry as a premier entertainment solution. Developing a commercial game is a complex, lengthy, and costly process. Therefore, quality assurance (QA) is critical for producing high-quality games that are fun and reasonably defect-free. Prior studies have explored game development methodologies and testing approaches, goals, and automation. However, they have not addressed the disparate contexts of independent (indie) and non-indie game development with respect to available funding and resources. Since indie games make up the lion’s share of newly released games each year, we want to empower their developers by maximizing their QA opportunities within their resource constraints. To lay the foundation for such support, we surveyed 19 game developers who have experience with commercially released games to learn about their QA experiences and perspectives based on 22 of their released game projects. Our survey results show that indies have less clear goals and plans for testing, perform tests on a conditional basis over a regular testing schedule, and have subjective test results.},

Attention is drawn to the legacy of conventional but deeply rooted mainstream approaches to studying projects and project management, and implications of the specific underpinning intellectual tradition for recommendations proposed to organisational members as best practice project management. The identified concerns and limitations are discussed in the context of project management evolution where taken-for-granted advantages of project management as a disciplined effective methodology and its popularity are reexamined. The paper sheds light on a variety of voices from both scholarly and practitioner communities that have attempted to respond to this paradox and move the field forward. Taking issue with conventional labels of project success or failure, and drawing attention to alternative theoretical and methodological propositions, the argument turns toward critical management studies, outlining the implications of this intellectual tradition for studies of projects, project management, project performance, and individual skills and competencies to cope with social arrangements labelled “projects.”},

  abstract = {?Crunch? ? a period of unpaid overtime meant to speed up lagging projects ? is a common labor practice in the video game industry and persists despite many costs to developers. To understand why, we conducted a critical discourse analysis of Game Developer magazine (2000?2010) to explore how industry members perceive and discuss gamework (1) in a publication for developers, by developers and (2) during the first decade in which serious conversations about labor emerge in the games industry. Our analysis found that many gameworkers treat crunch as ?inevitable? due to three specific themes: games as an unmanageable creative industry, an anti-corporate ethos, and a stereotypical developer identity based on passion and perfectionism. These constructions ? combined with the industry?s project-based nature and cultures of passion and secrecy ? build crunch into the habitus of gamework, helping reproduce exploitative labor practices. However, habitus can and does change over time, providing interested employees, companies, and labor organizers a means to intercede in existing work practices. We suggest a multipronged intervention that could build a healthier, more sustainable habitus of gamework.}

  author = {Dybå, Tore and Moe, Nils},
  date = {1999-10-01},
  abstract = {Much of the discussions on software process improvement (SPI) during the 1990s have focused on software process assessment and “best practice” models such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for software [11], and ISO/IEC 15504 (SPICE) [5]. In this paper we present a critique of the global “best practice” approach to software process assessment and improvement, focusing on the necessity to explore the contingencies of individual software organisations. Furthermore, we present some of our experiences in using tailor made assessments based on a participative approach to focus software process improvement activities in Norwegian software companies. The participative approach to software process assessment is part of the methodological basis used in a major Norwegian SPI program called SPIQ (Software Process Improvement for better Quality). The objective of SPIQ is to increase the competitiveness and profitability of Norwegian IT-industry through a systematic and continuos approach to process improvement. The goal of SPIQ is twofold: (1) to establish an environment for process improvement in software companies associated with SPIQ, and (2) to transfer and diffuse the knowledge gained to the remaining IT-industry in Norway through training, seminars, and conferences. The rest of this paper is organised into five sections. In the first section we discuss the role of assessment in SPI. Next, we present a participative approach to software process assessment, and our experiences with using this approach is then exemplified with two case studies. Finally we summarise our experiences in terms of lessons learned, and lastly we make some concluding remarks.}

By studying postmortems and conducting interviews with employees in the industry, we aim to characterise crunch time and discover its effects on the industry. We provide a classification of crunch, i.e., four types of crunch which all have distinct characteristics and affect the product, employees and schedule in various ways. One of the crunch types stands out from the others by only having positive effects on product and schedule. A characteristic that all of the types have in common is an increase in stress levels amongst the employees. We identify a set of reasons for crunch and show that crunch is less pronounced in game studios where prioritisation of features is a regular practice.},

  abstract = {For years psychologists across many subfields have undertaken the formidable challenge of designing survey scales to assess attitudes, opinions, and behaviors. Correspondingly, scholars have written much to guide researchers in this undertaking. Yet, many new scales violate established best practices in survey design, suggesting the need for a new approach to designing surveys. This article presents 6 steps to facilitate the construction of questionnaire scales. Unlike previous processes, this one front loads input from other academics and potential respondents in the item-development and revision phase with the goal of achieving credibility across both populations. Specifically, the article describes how (a) a literature review and (b) focus group?interview data can be (c) synthesized into a comprehensive list to facilitate (d) the development of items. Next, survey designers can subject the items to (e) an expert review and (f) cognitive pretesting before executing a pilot test.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The purpose of this paper is to explore a classic tool in project management, which for some has become almost synonymous with project management: the Gantt chart. The Gantt chart was developed in the early twentieth century, at the heart of Scientific Management; yet, the chart is used with very little adaptation across a wide range of types of projects. In this conceptual paper, the authors question its universal and unreflective use.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The authors analyse the conceptual roots of the Gantt chart, its historical development and use, derive its engrained principles, and analyse its implications to the management of projects.                                         Findings               While a Gantt chart can be useful to cope with some of the “complicatedness” of projects, and embraces the importance of time and timing, it is based on principles that are not valid to all projects. The consequence is a propagation of a management approach that does not explicitly cope with complexity, ambiguity, uncertainty and change. In that respect, the Gantt chart fails to acknowledge insights from years of organization theory research and project management research with a firm grounding in contingency theory.                                         Originality/value               While the majority of contemporary project management thinking already accepted that a normative use can be inappropriate, the practice is still pretty much embracing this approach. By showing the conceptual roots of the Gantt chart, the authors hope to make some of its limitations more evident to practitioners and academics, and encourage its use to be more reflective and contextualised.},

The innovation processes in the VGI are not rigorously explored and often treated like a " black-box ". Much attention has been towards game design and function, on the product innovation, not on the process. In this paper, patterns of interaction supporting innovation in the VGI are investigated through an engaged scholarship approach through interviews and observations with video game companies and informants in Norway. The findings show there are four identifiable patterns of interaction influencing the innovation process by reinforcing or hindering it. By understanding how the complex VGI environment and its actors interact, the company can increase its innovation capability and thereby its competitive advantage.}

However, we do not currently have theinfrastructure needed for widespread adoption of EBSE.The skill factor means software engineering experimentsare vulnerable to subject and experimenter bias. Thelifecycle factor means it is difficult to determine howtechnologies will behave once deployed.Conclusions: Software engineering would benefit fromadopting what it can of the evidence approach providedthat it deals with the specific problems that arise from thenature of software engineering.},

A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest.  Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

However, acquisitions are also known to trigger employee exit, which may diminish the very asset acquirers are trying to get under their control. We argue that acquisitions disrupt the complementarity between employee skills and employer activities and thereby impact the productivity in the value creation process, which ultimately drives exit decisions. Analyzing vertical acquisitions in the U.S. video game industry we find strong evidence that a higher degree of individual disruption translates into a higher likelihood of post-acquisition employee exit. Moreover, employees with specialized skills are more strongly affected by disruption, while generalized employees are less affected by disruption through acquisition.

Modern game development requires the effort of a team of skilled professionals to integrate multimedia content with complex software. Producing high-quality software game products requires large teams to rely on high levels of communication, organization, and planning to avoid costly delays and failures. The authors teach several courses dealing with the application of software engineering principles and art asset creation in the development of computer games at their respective institutions. ABET accreditation guidelines require students to participate on interdisciplinary teams to solve engineering problems. Students in the first author's advanced game design course work with students from the second author's game animation art course. This paper summarizes the content of the advanced game design course and the authors' experiences using development teams in game design courses. Student evaluations of this interdisciplinary team course offering indicate high levels of satisfaction.},

At present, there are no commonly accepted VGD best practices or frameworks that can bring together the complex and competing needs of software engineering and creative production. Although studios are reportedly using agile frameworks, the actual extent of application and effectiveness of agile practices in the VGD context is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to empirically determine how and why agile frameworks are applied in VGD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight New Zealand VGD studios. It was found that the agile frameworks, Scrum and Kanban, must often be adapted from their conventional use to meet the needs of different pipelines and delivery milestones within the phases of VGD. However, it seems that not all the needs of VGD can be met by current agile frameworks. Furthermore, inexperience with agile practices often leads to misunderstanding and misimplementing them in ways that seem to contribute to commonly experienced collaboration challenges.},

This imbalance is a problem if video game development differs from general software development, as some game experts suggest. In this paper we describe a study with 14 interviewees and 364 survey respondents. The study elicited substantial differences between video game development and other software development. For example, in game development, “cowboy coders” are necessary to cope with the continuous interplay between creative desires and technical constraints. Consequently, game developers are hesitant to use automated testing because of these tests’ rapid obsolescence in the face of shifting creative desires of game designers. These differences between game and non-game development have implications for research, industry, and practice. For instance, as a starting point for impacting game development, researchers could create testing tools that enable game developers to create tests that assert flexible behavior with little up-front investment.},

Nevertheless, improving team collaboration and process support is an ongoing challenge to enable a comprehensive view on game development projects.

Based on a state of the practice survey in the Austrian games industry, this paper presents (a) first results with focus on process/method support and (b) suggests a candidate flexible process approach based on Scrum to improve VGSD and team collaboration.

Software Process Improvement (SPI) initiatives for game development are discussed. The factors that promote or deter the adoption of process models, and implementing SPI in practice are highlighted. Our findings indicate that there is no single model that serves as a best practice process model for game development and it is a matter of deciding which model is best suited for a particular game. Agile models such as Scrum and XP are suited to the knowledge intensive domain of game development where innovation and speed to market are vital. Hybrid approaches such as reuse can also be suitable for game development where the risk of the upfront investment in terms of time and cost is mitigated with a game that has stable requirements and a longer lifespan.},

To explore the status of game development in this pivotal moment, we have conducted semi-structured interviews with 27 immigrant/expatriate game developers ("game expats") in Finland analyzing their migration push and pull on societal, industrial, social, and individual factors. The results indicate societal and industrial factors simultaneously influencing game expats' migration intention, but with an increasing influence of game corporation's role on developers' both on-the-job and off-the-job embeddedness due to an absence of (local) community activities during the pandemic. The data also reveals that game developers are valuing the physical workspace for face-to-face interactions, despite the industrial norm of digital tools and seamless transition to remote work. Furthermore, an alarming stratification and hierarchization within the game industry were identified, which game developers self-dividing in-house versus outsourced workforce even if they were both required to work remotely. This paper contributes to game studies on game developers' experiences as an attempt to investigate the local context of game development. It is also one of the first snapshots of game work practices in Finland during the Covid-19 era.},

The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions. OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps. METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews. RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for doing systematic maps are defined. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).},

In this paper, we present a survey of software engineering processes in video game industry from postmortem project analyses. We analyzed 20 postmortems from Gamasutra Portal. We extracted their processes and modelled them through using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). This work presents three main contributions. First, a postmortem analysis methodology to identify and extract project processes. Second, the study main result: the "old days" are gone, but not completely. Iterative practices are increasing and are applied to at least 65\% of projects in which 45\% of this projects explicitly adopted Agile practices. However, waterfall process is still applied at least 30\% of projects. Finally, we discuss some implications, directions and opportunities for video game development community.},

However, the software engineering field and, more precisely, game development processes seems to be forgotten by researchers. In addition, game developers and big game companies prefer to keep their processes and methodologies to themselves. Studies and professional reports have shown the " ugly face " behind the game industry. Crunch Times and heavy pressure during the development are treated as normal practices in a game developer's life. In this work, we surveyed 58 Brazilian game developers about the relations between game development process and problems in a software engineering context. We sought for answers based on empirical data collected from the questionnaire. The goal was to understand the area and provide insights to improve game development, pointing a direction for future researches. As a result, considering the Brazilian context, this paper presents three main contributions. The first shows that, on projects that used systematic approaches, regardless of the type, result in better products. The second presents that Delays, Unrealistic scope and Lack of documentation are the most common problems faced by game developers. Finally, we describe insights and considerations gathered from developers and literature studies, which may serve as a source of knowledge as well as characterization of the Brazilian game developers.}

In the present study, a wide variety of items, covering a range of up-to-date technology and media usage behaviors. Sixty-six items concerning technology and media usage, along with 18 additional items assessing attitudes toward technology, were administered to two independent samples of individuals, comprising 942 participants. Factor analyses were used to create 11 usage subscales representing smartphone usage, general social media usage, Internet searching, e-mailing, media sharing, text messaging, video gaming, online friendships, Facebook friendships, phone calling, and watching television in addition to four attitude-based subscales: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, technological anxiety/dependence, and attitudes toward task-switching. All subscales showed strong reliabilities and relationships between the subscales and pre-existing measures of daily media usage and Internet addiction were as predicted. Given the reliability and validity results, the new Media and Technology Usage and Attitudes Scale was suggested as a method of measuring media and technology involvement across a variety of types of research studies either as a single 60-item scale or any subset of the 15 subscales.},

When undertaking postal surveys, it is common to improve response rates by contacting survey recipients multiple times encouraging them to complete the questionnaire. The ethical implications of the use of multiple reminders are rarely discussed in the literature advocating their use. The paper briefly reviews the arguments encouraging use of multiple reminders, and identifies and discusses the potential ethical issues raised by their use in postal surveys. A set of principles is then proposed for using multiple reminders in an ethically responsible way. It is argued that by following these principles, the use of multiple reminders should present no increased potential for harassment or coercion of survey recipients compared to alternative survey techniques. The use of these principles in a recent postal survey is then presented and discussed; a 60\% response rate was achieved utilising multiple survey reminders in a way consistent with this set of principles.},

In this paper the authors offer their perspective about the challenge that the project management research community is facing today. The authors propose several research directions that may evolve as central in the next few years in order to stimulate the discussion and debate about the future of the discipline. They first look at project management research from a problem-driven perspective and than offer three central views with which project management could be perceived: the strategic/business view, the operational/process view, and the team/leadership view. For each one the governing thought pattern, the theories, and the related disciplines are presented. Although these views are certainly not unique, they may provide an integrated perspective of the discipline and a possible trigger for further discussion that may help attract scholars from other more established academic disciplines and improve the status of project management research.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the forces that influence creativity in the video games industry. We adopt a qualitative approach to guide the development of grounded theory across multiple levels of analysis, including the industry (consisting of multiple actors), organizational, and individual creator levels. Our study shows that business and production interests currently drive the rationalization of video game production. There is a maturing trend, with product designs becoming well established as genres, and consumers and publishers desiring incrementally innovative games. This leads publishers to focus on acquiring intellectual property, and publishers and studios alike to make incrementally innovative sequels. The increasing complexity of products leads to further rationalization in their development. However, the need to satisfy consumers' continually evolving tastes and game developers' inclinations to be creative also creates tensions with these rational forces. Different actors balance these tensions differently. Studios may seek to balance these by shifting between more and less innovative products, by creating original intellectual property to increase their bargaining power with publishers, and by iterating and repositioning products during development to adapt them to the market. Publishers may enhance their portfolio by hiring highly creative designers into their stable. New products are created through combinative creativity, that is, the recombination of existing ideas from different sources into new products. The connection of combinative mechanisms with the balancing behavior at the firm level provides a means for understanding the evolution of innovative products and, therefore, industries.}

Relying on qualitative data from a variety of sources including our own interviews and ethnographic work, and, a sourcebook on videogames, we are assured of the existence of three facets of creativity-based game design: idea creation, constructivism and evolution. The implications of a creativity-based framework for design are that game design features might result from conventionally known creative processes such as insight or inspiration, or from the form of creativity that ‘blends’ disparate concepts together in novel ways by adapting, adding or combining them. This latter form is what we term ‘constructivism’ or ‘constructivist thinking’ – something which increasingly digital or content-driven products (i.e., virtual) that are freeform in nature could require. A constructivist approach to game design suggests that games can be seen to be comprised of features from past games and other media or products, and thus as a consequence, the heritage of products are quite straightforward to discern. Furthermore, evolutionary processes can now be viewed as the outcome of these constructivist and idea creation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {This paper is a first attempt to systematically explore the main characteristics of videogames and the particular problems encountered in their development. As an example of an emerging creative industry, videogames are an instance of what we term interactive experiential products. Our study is based on 65 project reports, which were used to examine how the product's interactive nature created certain characteristics in the product's development processes. We find that videogame development displays experiential processes similar to those used in other products which embody "experiential" development processes, such as frequent milestones and testing, multiple design iterations, multifunctional teams and strong project leadership. We also show that there are some subtleties or peculiarities that are specific to games even within these characteristics, such as more complex concurrent development, pipelining and integration issues. Some characteristics are more unique to videogame development, such as "feature creep" and "feature iteration". In general, this results from the complex combination of technology, (creative) game design and (artistic) content within videogames, which causes complexity and uncertainty in the development process. At one extreme, videogames may suffer from not being subject to a full testing cycle until near the end of the project, and given the high uncertainty of consumer's receptivity to the product, this makes for a difficult development situation. While the use of more rational development processes (such as formal software development practices from software engineering) could help with these issues, new thinking can also be done in the future about whether new and more appropriate product development models can be developed to address the needs of videogame development.}

The analysis relies on a pilot study about the issue of the professional identity of gameworkers, which aimed to dig deeper with the means of qualitative research. During that project nine German gameworkers were interviewed and an attempt to give an in-depth description of their professional identity was made. The study shows that the respondents have a very strong coherence with their profession and perceive themselves as a part of their profession and the team/studio they work with/at.

Results: The guidelines for using snowballing as a way to search for relevant literature was successfully applied to a systematic literature review. Conclusions: It is concluded that using snowballing, as a first search strategy, may very well be a good alternative to the use of database searches.},

  abstract = {This dissertation examines the emergence of everyday gamemakers and their roles in transforming the cultural norms and practices of the global video game industry. Everyday gamemakers are digital game creators who share multiple professional and leisure-based gamemaking identities, including developers, “indies,” modders, user-generated content creators, and writers of interactive fiction. Since the Apple App Store opened in 2008, game engines and digital venues have developed and enabled widespread production and distribution of digital games. Game engines such as Unity3D, GameMaker Studio, and Construct 2, which simplify the process of making a digital game using “drag-and-drop” tools and editors, have enabled a range of gamemakers with no programming or artistic experience and training to create digital games. The simultaneous release of digital platforms such as Google Play, Steam, and itch.io, has also streamlined the process of distributing digital games into new and traditional communities of players. These developments have emerged because the video game industry perceives everyday gamemakers to be innovators in diversifying and producing products, creating jobs, and increasing profits. However, I argue that the inclusion of the everyday gamemaker has simultaneously enabled local and grassroots norms and practices to transform the production process of digital game creation in the global video game industry. To demonstrate how these gamemakers are changing norms and practices across the industry, I focus on gamemakers’ work and leisure identities as creators of digital games; the cultural activities of the scenes in which they participate; the game engines and tools of production they use to make their games; the working conditions in which they build their games; and the distribution platforms on which they release their games. I argue that gamemakers wear many labour hats within their craft of gamemaking, which not only diversifies the work and leisure contexts of digital game production, but also enables the mixing and transformation of cultural norms and practices within the mainstream industry and the places of leisure more broadly.}

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to identify, characterize, and discuss paradigm shifts that have occurred in the video game industry with some emphasis on competition and competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach – Basically, the paper depends upon a review of the literature associated with video game development. Past history is taken from texts and academic papers dealing with the subject. More current observations are taken from the business and popular press. These observations are placed within a context associated with the classic papers on industry evolution, paradigms, paradigm shifts, competition, and competitiveness. Findings – It is difficult to capture present shifts in such a fast‐growing industry, but these shifts seem clear: the original entry of video games into the arcade sector that led to the industry and the demise of pinball; the development of the home cartridge and console that made the industry a home‐based phenomenon; the entry of independent game‐publishers that made the industry a two‐tiered one; and the development of massively multiplayer online role‐playing games (MMORPGs) that changed the way games are played. Originality/value – The video game industry is an interesting one to follow. To an extent, its development characterizes our generation – fast paced, technologically oriented, and targeted toward the young and young at heart. This paper takes the subject away from a historical or anecdotal approach and places it within the context of industry evolution, paradigms, and paradigm shifts. It thus should be of value to students of not only video games, but also the evolution of rapidly growing industries and establishment of competitive advantages.},

  abstract = {Agile Software Development is characterized by collaborative social interactions and fast-paced and iterative changes in project requirements. Much of the extant Agile development literature focuses on team and organizational aspects of Agile development projects. However, coordination mechanisms used within Agile projects have received less attention. Particularly, existing research lacks a discussion on how artifacts are applied in Agile software development to support project coordination, and how their potential for information richness and mutability impact their ability to support coordination. To address these issues, we conducted a case study of an Agile development project that involved customer and vendor organizations. Our case follows the interactions between the two organizations, identifies the different types of artifacts that they utilized to coordinate their joint activities throughout the various phases of the project, and traces the enactment of these artifacts' informational potential. Our study reveals that the organizations applied four different types of coordination artifacts - Foundational, Projective, Exposition and Indicative artifacts – to address different coordination challenges that arose throughout the project. The four types of artifacts were characterized by varying levels of information richness and mutability, which were shaped to support the Agile activities within which they were used. Our study enriches the understanding of the role of coordination artifacts in Agile projects, provides insights on the informational potential of the artifacts, and highlights some of the pitfalls than can result from misunderstanding object use.},
