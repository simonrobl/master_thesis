## Abstract
The German game industry is facing significant challenges and demonstrates a clear need for innovations that allow it to compete internationally. Such innovations could be driven by a potential change in project management approaches, which have historically been necessary gamechangers for enabling sustainable and resilient software development practices. The goal of my thesis is to explore the working methods and structure of commercial digital games developed in Germany in order to provide an openly accessible, scientifically grounded basis for future research. An online survey was  conducted following guidelines from prior research done in Austria, Brazil, Finland, and New Zealand. The structure of development teams and the types of frameworks, meetings, and artifacts are investigated through the lens of individual game workers at a variety of studio sizes. This enables new types of insights into job roles and remote work
within the German game industry, while preserving the ability to gather general information about an individual studioâ€™s approach to game development. A first in this line of research, the survey design and process are documented and made available alongside anonymized results. Key findings are comparable to previous research, such as a majority of participants working in a massively parallelized fashion with hybrid and iterative process management frameworks. The survey provides additional ways of understanding how game workers themselves experience these frameworks, and ascertains problem areas without tying itself to specific management practices. Additional interviews further contextualize the German game industry and show that the experienced problems are largely the same as in other countries. 

## Repository structure and licensing

The repository is split into two folders with different licensing:

- [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) contains a list of German and English questions in queXML format, a preview version of the English survey as PDF, and anonymized results from all 50 participants as a CSV file. The folder also contains a list of contacted studios derived from [gamesmap](https://www.gamesmap.de), and a BibTeX file containing all the papers I discovered during my research.
- [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) contains my master thesis, as well as a shortened research paper version. These will be made available by 15th of June 2023, pending my colloquium on the 6th of June to account for potential changes made afterward.

## Understanding the results
A thorough explanation of the survey design, data processing and anonymization steps, as well as a discussion of the findings and interpretation of results is provided within my master thesis, as well as the shortened research paper version.
For a quick start, take a look at the `results.csv`.

Each row represents a different participant. Each participant was found to be from a different company. 

Each column indicates the associated question. Sometimes questions provided a plethora of data, in such cases there will be multiple columns associated with the same question. I suggest taking a look at `preview.pdf` to gain a better understanding of the question types and their full text.

In cases where data was highly specific, it is represented as closed and half-open intervals to preserve the anonymity of participants.  Question 4 is omitted, as the number of participants and variety of answers did not provide sufficient anonymity.
In cases where participants chose not to answer a question, the associated cell is marked with an `x`. For multiple-choice questions and optional questions cells are left blank where participants didn't choose an answer.

## Questions and Feedback
If you have any questions or want to provide feedback, you can do so by opening a new issue and marking it as `question` or `feedback`. I'll make sure to get to it as soon as I have time :)
